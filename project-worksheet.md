# Project Overview
Building a website using the skills learned from unit one of the course. The website will include different sections that overall display you as a person and the projects you've made. This website will be your portfolio.
## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Project Description

This website application I am creating is to help me display skills that I've learned during the first unit of the General Assembly SEI bootcamp. The website features several things such as: 
-  About Me page 
-  Projects page
-  Contacts


## Google Sheet

[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19e4t4KraAs82HfJFbNtUUlCGuqxu0JTm1UD7AuunRUk/edit?usp=sharing) 

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

Using Flexbox, I was able to make a column of divs. I changed the font size based on size of media, and and was able to fit it all within the screen of a iPhone X. It works for a width lower than an iPhone X as well. The hamburger menu will also appear as well for menu scrolling convinience.

[Tablet Rough Draft](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpggcudix/image/upload/v1594599888/Screen_Shot_2020-07-12_at_8.10.29_PM_ijmz28.png)

Very similar to what I wanted my desktop to look like, it just has some sizing differences between the divs and the banner looks a little more compact which is fine.

A navigation bar on top, the middle is a banner, below that are some blocks I did with CSS Grid to go to different pages in the same site. Finally, there is a contact section below that. 


## Time/Priority Matrix

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Homepage | H | 5hr | -hr | -hr|
| Navigation Bar | H | 2hr | -hr | -hr|
| Icon | L | 4H | -hr | -hr|
| Navigation Bar Links | H | 1hr| -hr | -hr |
| About Me Page| M | 3hr | -hr | -hr|
| Working with API | H | 4hrs| -hr | -hr |
| Media Responsive | H | 5hr | -hr | -hr|
| Social Media Icons | L | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Projects Page | M | 3hr | -hr | -hr|
| Contacts | M | 2hr | -hr | -hr|
| Total | H | 30hrs| -hrs | -hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Sliding transitions | M | 6hr | -hr | -hr|
